## **Kquika - AI-Driven Predictive Insights for Aviation Hardware Health**

### Client Problem
An aviation company faced challenges in accurately forecasting flight demand and optimizing aircraft utilization. Their existing methods were insufficient in predicting customer booking behavior, leading to overcapacity on some flights and underutilization on others, which resulted in lost revenue opportunities and increased operational costs.

### Our Solution
We developed an advanced predictive analysis platform specifically for the aviation industry.

This model was deployed on a cloud-based infrastructure, ensuring scalability and real-time data processing.

This led to a 20% increase in overall revenue, as the company was able to adjust pricing strategies and marketing efforts based on accurate forecasts. Additionally, the improved predictive capabilities allowed for better customer service by providing passengers with more reliable flight options and dynamic pricing tailored to their booking behavior.
